Each of the over one and a half million computers registered as part of the Internet has a unique address that allows its multiple users to receive what is called Åge-mailÅh or electronic mail.
From these central computers, e-mail is distributed to the individual users, whose e-mail addresses may or may not correspond to their main computerÅfs Internet address.
Amazingly, this complicated system usually works very well.
Besides personal use, e-mail is often used to distribute newsletters, say, from one office or individual to a particular group of users.
This is a very efficient way to disseminate information, as no paper is used, the receivers are known, and it is very fast.
Even e-mail sent around the world usually reaches its destination within a matter of seconds.

The Chinese were making a noodle-like food as early as 3000 B.C. Pasta made its way to the New World with the English, who discovered it while touring Italy.
